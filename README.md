# The Questions:

	2)Does a famous sports player's MVP status influence the popularity of babies named after their MVP recognition?
	3)Do characters from top movies names influence the popularity of babies named after their release?
	- No they seem to have no affect on the popularity of the name (see movie_exploration.ipynb)
	
	4)Does Disney Character's names influence the popularity of babies named after the film's release?
